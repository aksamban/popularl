# popularl
PopulaRL is an open-source Python Module that implements my research in Meta-RL and Representation Learning.
This is a **work-in-progress** Meta-Reinforcement Learning library that integrates MAML with VAE-based task encoding.

## Features (Planned & Implemented)
- [x] MAML-based adaptation
- [x] VAE for task inference
- [ ] Support for more environments
- [ ] Optimization improvements

## Installation
```bash
pip install popularl
